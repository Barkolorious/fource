# $\text{\textbf{\color{#007FFF}FOURCE}: \textbf{\color{#007FFF}Four}ier based \textbf{\color{#007FFF}C}omplex \textbf{\color{#007FFF}E}ncryption}$

A secure algorithm that uses both *Discrete Fourier Transformation* and *linear algebra*. Strong points of the algorithm include:

* **No data loss:** Data before encryption and after decryption is always the same (if there isn't any hardware issue).
* **The chaos in the key matrix:** Since we use DFT to both
